            It is the ambassador’s stinging response to this question, as
            recorded by John Adams, that is now most remembered, cited by
            countless sources. Reportedly, ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān asserted that “War”
            against non-Muslims was scripturally sanctioned; plunder and piracy
            against infidels was “founded on the law of their great Profet.”14
            Framing Islam not as a source of peace, but of perpetual conflict,
            the ambassador is quoted as justifying conquest and cap- tivity,
            asserting “that it was written in the Koran, that all Nations who
            should not have acknowledged their [Tripoli’s] Authority were
            sinners: that it was their right & duty to make war upon them
            wherever they could be found, & to make slaves of all they could
            take as prisoners.”
