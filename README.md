# afro-discord-build
This build will be an HTML and CSS build, with future Js functionality.

# pull request protocol
all pull requests will require a review from at least 1 collaborator before being pushed to main

all collaborators will create their own branch and commit their updates to their own branch before submitting a pull request

available collaborators will view updates in browser and make decisions based on performance of updates

CSS3 

these will be the primary languages and maybe will add some javascript once some of the collaborators have a better grasp of it.
